# DEPRECATION NOTICE
This branch will be retired and the MDC branch will be merged into this one. Currently, we use **MDL** (Material Design Lite, https://www.getmdl.io) and after some serious consideration, we decided to migrate over to **MDC** (Material Design Components for the Web, https://www.material.io). Hence, a redesign. Our team is working around the clock to get this major step forward for Paradigm.

### Timeline
This project should be completed by 1/25/2018. This is not a final date and is subject to change.

The team is answering your questions about this upgrade. Email us at paradigmdevelop@gmail.com.
